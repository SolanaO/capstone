# Capstone Proposal and Project

This project is part of my Machine Learning Engineer - Udacity Nanodegree Program. In this capstone project I am performing sentiment analysis on Amazon Unlocked Mobile Reviews, which is available on Kaggle datasets. The methods used here involve word embeddings, supervised learning algorithms and deep learning techniques.
